## Photo manipulation and filter setter ##


CamanJS is a photo manipulation library for JavaScript.
As easy as it is to use, there are a few drawbacks to using this library such as with browser compatibility, 
the main problem is with google chrome where recent updates now block data corruption which renders
CamanJS useless. This application goes around these problems. It allows for photo upload, photo manipulation, 
and image saving functions that were otherwise completely blocked by chrome.
